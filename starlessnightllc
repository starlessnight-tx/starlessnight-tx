 Starless Night LLC is dedicated to providing quality products and services for the lawful public, Law Enforcement, Government, DoD or Corporations. The name Starless Night refers to an evening where there is no moon and no stars. It is as dark as the night can get. As a young service member, I conducted night land navigation under these conditions. It was dangerous stumbling through the dark using a lensatic compass to guide me from point to point. Training was crucial to successful course completion.
